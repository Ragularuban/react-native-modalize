# Modalize

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-modalize.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-modalize)

**This package is still in an early stage, use it with caution.** ðŸ––

A modal that loves ScrollViews.

This component had been built with `react-native-gesture-handler` to address the common issue of scrolling and swipping behaviors you can face with a modal with react-native. This component is built-in with a `ScrollView`, you don't have to include it by yourself, just pass your content, and the component will handle the rest for you.

It resolves the following issues:

- Swipping to dismiss Modalize
- Scrolling within a ScrollView
- Handling the keyboard automatically
