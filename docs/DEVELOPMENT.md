# Development

There are 3 examples made to make the development more reliable.

- React Native Navigation
- React Navigation
- Expo

The components are shared between these examples and are used as a local npm package `react-native-modalize/shared` and you can find the source in the `examples-shared` folder.

If you want to create a new modal, for example, you will have to create the three different reference for each example.

To run these examples, check out [this page](/EXAMPLES.md).
